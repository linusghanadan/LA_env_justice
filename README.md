# LA Environmental Justice Analysis
## Purpose
This analysis will use environmental data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and biodiversity data from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Specifically, I will map wastewater discharge for census block groups in Los Angeles and compare this to another map that I'll make showing Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades in Los Angeles from the 1930-1940s. Then, I'll join the HOLC data with the biodiversity data to see how bird observations differ across historically redlined areas.
